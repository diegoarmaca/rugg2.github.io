In this file I will write quite a bit of math. Let's see how the Latex editor works

Here is one example:

$$
R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda
= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu}
$$

Here is another example:

\[
R_{\mu \nu}- {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda
= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu}
\]

inline:

Here she comes to wreck the day. $\int -xe^{x^2} dx$ it's because i'm
green isn't it! hey, maybe i will give you a call sometime. your number
still 911? kinda hot in $\int -xe^{x^2} dx$ these rhinos. look at that,
it's exactly three seconds before i honk your $\int -xe^{x^2} dx$ nose and
pull your underwear over your head.

Ok, this didn't quite work. I'm gonna try this external service:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{E=mc^2}{\gamma&space;\sum&space;\beta_i}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{E=mc^2}{\gamma&space;\sum&space;\beta_i}" title="\frac{E=mc^2}{\gamma \sum \beta_i}" /></a>

And try it without the link and see if it works

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{E=mc^2}{\gamma&space;\sum&space;\beta_i}" title="\frac{E=mc^2}{\gamma \sum \beta_i}" />
