## Data Science portfolio - the t
My name is Romain, and I have 4 years' professional experience in the healthcare industry as a consultant, project leader and scientist. Prior to that I worked as a M&A analyst in the energy industry and as a rocket scientist. I am also a graduate from the University of Cambridge, and I hold a MSc in Math and Physics from Ecole Centrale Paris.

All my professional work is confidential. And until now, I never took the time to capture my side projects, so work in progress, and suggestions welcomed!

### Long projects (a few months)
- **Space-time analysis of eddies captured by ADCP devices**. Work done at the Whittle Laboratory at Cambridge around 2013. The aim was to help tidal turbines work better, as many were working well in the lab but broke on site. I looked at the most popular tool used in marine environment to measure currents and eddies: the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). I found that there is a significant gap in the frequency and size of eddies this tool could capture. And this blind spot is right in the range that can break tidal turbines and is site-dependant. This led to a conference presentation at Oceans14 in St John's, Canada, and [a few papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7003057/).
- **Transportation network design optimization using custom genetic algorithms - application to Hong Kong railway**. Work done at Ecole Centrale Paris in 2011. In this project we were looking at transportation networks, and given certain nodes and passenger journeys, how best to chose lines running through them. One part of the team looked at applying standard algorithms, and I was developed my own evolutionary algorithms and have implemented it in C++. I defined lines as entities that could mate, and the mating process would have evolutionary-inspired processes such as mutations, crossing over etc. To set the evolutionary pressure I came up with a purpose made Lagrangian multiplier, which really had a massive impact on the optimization performance. With the same team we made a broad review of artificial intelligence techniques at the time. We also quickly looked at teaching a bot to move on a 2D grid and get food using a very basic reinforcement learning technique, but the algorithm was barely better than random! (oups!)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rugg2/rugg2.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
