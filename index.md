## Data Science portfolio - the tip of the iceberg
My name is Romain, and I have 4 years' professional experience in the healthcare industry as a consultant, project leader and scientist. Prior to that I worked as a M&A analyst in the energy industry and as a rocket scientist. I am also a graduate from the University of Cambridge, and I hold a MSc in Math and Physics from Ecole Centrale Paris.

All my professional work is confidential. And until now, I never took the time to capture my side projects, so work in progress, and suggestions welcomed!

_(Note: one bit of my work that is public are [my patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=romain+guion&oq=romain+guion))_

### Long projects (a few months)
- **Current project: multi-user movie recommandation system**. I am working in collaboration with a Java developer on doing an app that makes movie nights between friends smoother. I am doing algorithm aspect - this multi-user / multi-preference machine learning algorithm. If the algorithm works well, there may be many applications. The current approach is to experiment around collaborative filtering and low rank matrix factorisation. I won't same more for now.

- **Current contracting role - management consultant and data scientist for Padam.io**. Padam brings AI-powered on-demand bus services to medium and low density areas. My intervention is focused on the UK market. My mission started very broad: how can we improve our clients' profit, and Padam's service in general. I started framing generic revenue and cost questions, and went down to product management questions. I then got access to 3 years of an anonymised database, and mapped growth bottlenecks and potential levers. I then went on to define KPIs for customer retention and operational efficiency, and I am working on optimised processes to increase those. The details are obviously confidential.

- **Space-time analysis of eddies captured by ADCP devices**. Work done at the Whittle Laboratory at Cambridge around 2013. The aim was to help tidal turbines work better, as many were working well in the lab but broke on site. I looked at the most popular tool used in marine environment to measure currents and eddies: the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). I found that there is a significant gap in the frequency and size of eddies this tool could capture. And this blind spot is right in the range that can break tidal turbines and is site-dependant. This led to a conference presentation at Oceans14 in St John's, Canada, and [a few papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7003057/).

- **Transportation network design optimization using custom genetic algorithms - application to Hong Kong railway**. Work done at Ecole Centrale Paris in 2011. In this project we were looking at transportation networks, and given certain nodes and passenger journeys, how best to chose lines running through them. One part of the team looked at applying standard algorithms, and I was developed my own evolutionary algorithms and have implemented it in C++. I defined lines as entities that could mate, and the mating process would have evolutionary-inspired processes such as mutations, crossing over etc. To set the evolutionary pressure I came up with a purpose made Lagrangian multiplier, which really had a massive impact on the optimization performance. With the same team we made a broad review of artificial intelligence techniques at the time. We also quickly looked at teaching a bot to move on a 2D grid and get food using a very basic reinforcement learning technique, but the algorithm was barely better than random! (oups!)

### Mid-size projects (a few days)
- **Workshop at HIT: Kaggle Titanic dataset and Raspberry Pi capacity-touch sensor and camera for object recognition**. Check-out my [kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/romainguion/titanic-a-thinking-process). I prepared this quickly for a workshop I co-led at the Harare Institute of Technology (Zimbabwe) in 2017. We had 13 second and fourth year cybersecurity students and a couple of professors attending our workshop. We designed the workshop to broaden their horizon, and help them independantly explore a few topics. Entrepreneuship is vital in Zim. We chose to introduce them to Data Science with the titanic dataset, as they then become part of the Kaggle community and can keep on learning by themselves. We thought hardware was also important, so we brought a few Raspberry Pis, and explored two modules: capacity-touch sensor and the camera. The capacity-touch sensor was relevant for the students to detect when people touch a door handle or another conductive surface. For the workshop we ended up doing something more interactive and build a piano using spoons, apples and bananas. The camera was for intrusion detection, using openCV and tensorflow for image recognition. The rational is that motion sensors create a lot of false positive alerts, as they can be triggered by a moving branch, a dog, or someone authorized to be in the house. We thought this could become a business, but realised [Google had been working with Nest for a year to do just that](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/09/08/nest-gives-its-security-cameras-brains-using-googles-computer-vision-software/#1cfc2be3413f). Competing with Google on AI is hard.
